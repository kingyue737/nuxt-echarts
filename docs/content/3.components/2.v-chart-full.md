`<VChartFull>` will render a chart on the server then on the client once mounted in the browser.

Usage of `VChartFull` is almost the same as [`VChart`](/components/v-chart). Besides, `VChartFull` provides functionality of Server-side Rendering.

::warning
The client 'halve' of `<VChartFull>` is based on Nuxt [client-only component](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components#client-components) which is rendered only after being mounted. To access the rendered template using `onMounted()`, add `await nextTick()` in the callback of the `onMounted()` hook.
