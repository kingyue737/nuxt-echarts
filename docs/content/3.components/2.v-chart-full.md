If [`ssr`](/getting-started/configuration#ssr) is turned on, `<VChart>` will render a chart on the server then on the client once mounted in the browser.

::tip
Usage of `VChart` is almost the same as [`Vue-ECharts`](https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts). Besides, `VChart` provides functionality of Server-side Rendering.
::

::warning
When [`ssr`](/getting-started/configuration#ssr) is turned on, the client 'halve' of `<VChart>` is based on Nuxt [client-only component](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components#client-components) which is rendered only after being mounted. To access the rendered template using `onMounted()`, add `await nextTick()` in the callback of the `onMounted()` hook.
